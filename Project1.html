       <h2>How it started</h2>
       <p>Everyone knows that 2020 was a rough year, and if you don't know then congratulations you're a hermit.
       All jokes aside, during 2020 many people were working from home and with the lack of commute, found that they had extra time.
       In this regard I was no different, however, I was so BORED. Until one day as I was browsing YouTube, I came accross
       particularly cool modelling video. This video demonstrated how to create "Floating Islands" thus I decided to give it a try.</p>
       <source>
         <h2> Here's the original creator</h2>
         <p>This video is the propert of the youtube North Of the Border</p>

       <h2>Materials</h2>
       <p>Before I could make the project, I had to get the materials.
         <ul>
              <li>Sculpture Block - Type of very dense foam, similar to plant foam</li>
              <li>Perspex sheets - Also know as acrylic sheet but at no more tham 5 mm thick</li>
              <li>Some soft foam - Different shades of green, can get this at a modelling shop or online</li>
              <li>Modelling wire - Very thin, aluminium. How else would you make trees!?</li>
              <li>Paint - Acrylic please</li>
              <li>Plaster -Plaster of paris can be used. It'll make sense later I swear.</li>
              <li>Epoxy resin and dye - This is a <b>TOXIC SUBSTANCE, do NOT use without parental supervision OR protective equipment.</b>
              </li><img src="PPE.jpg" alt="PPE equipment yoga" class="right">
              <li>MDF(Medium Density Fiberboard) - Gotta have a base any size/shape mine was 10 x 15 cm.</li>
              <li>Some sand - If you want</li>
              <li>Black wash - can use modelling black wash or can make it yourself with watered down black paint.</li>
              <li>Mod Podge gloss - or can use any other thin glossy glue</li>
              <li>Gel medium - Waves are needed.</li>
      </ul></p>
    </material>
    <process>
       <h2>The Process</h2>
       <h3> 1. Preparing the foam</h3>
       <ol>
            <li>How big do you want your island? I did not want mine to be very thick, only about twice as thick as the sculting foam.
            So I cut out two rectangular pieces from the foam board and stuck them together using Mod Podge - or attempted to anyway (more details in the "Disaster" section).</li>
            <li>Once the foam was firmly glued together, it was time to start rough shaping. The benefit of using sculpting foam is that it can be sanded
            or cut without chunks falling off (Unless thats the effect you want).</li>
            <li>Next was the finer shaping - but first, <b>*Quick warning- if you are attempting this at home be <em>EXTREMELY CAREFUL</em>, children <em>DO NOT</em> attempt this without a parent/guardian present!*</b>
            Using a hobby knife, I slashed the foam in different directions, some gashes were repetedly done to give depth/width to the foam - this will help to add a realistic
          rock texture when painting later on. Once this is done to your satisfacion, brush off the loose foam and coat the island(s) in Mod Podge. You may need a couple of layers. Make sure you gouge out a "cave" for your waterfall".<img src="making model.jpg" alt="Man assembling a model" class="centercircle"</li>
            <li>Once the glue is dry, the plaster is added. Only a thin layer, we dont want to lose all the details! After the first plaster layer was dry, the second was added.</li>
            <li>After the plaster is firmly dry, take the hobby knife and cut/ gash a bit more - not too deeply though, this is just for greater surface detail.</li>
            <li>Next comes the painting. My plaster dried as a dark grey colour so I skipped the base coat of dark grey. I did a heavy "dry brushing" on the islands with a lighter grey paint.
            The islands did not have to have full coverage with this paint, just enough to add some colour variation. Next i dry brushed the entirety of the islands with white paint, before also dry brushing with
          greens and browns (when applying the green/brown paint don't cover the entire island, just do it in some spots).<img src="floating islands small rocks sea.jpeg" alt="showing rock colour" class="right"></li>
            <li>The final touch to the coating is a black wash - make sure it seeps into all the crevices and cracks, you can pat the surface of the islands dry/ dry the overspill.</li>
          </ol>
        <h3> 2. Preparing the waterfalls</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Get the perspex sheet and measure out rectangle- ensure that the width will fit into yout island "cave(s)". Also ensure that it is long enough to bend into the cave, and have a long enough bend at the bottom for gluing.</li>
          <li>Once the strip of perspex has been cut out, you need to bend the plastic in a U-shape. The top of the U (going into the cave) can't be longer than the depth of the cave. My top U was approximatey 1.5 cm.
          The bottom U (will attach to the base). My bottom U was approx 2 - 3 cm long. Measuring the requireed distances from both ends, I bent the plastic to 90 degrees using a heat gun and a clamp to hold it in place.</li>
          <img src="Floating islands no resin.jpg" alt="Floating islands without resin" class="right">
          <li> With the perspex now bent, I glued the upper part of the U into the cave in my islands.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3> 3. Assembly </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Now the islands are glued to the base - this can be done using any glue. I had some extra chunks of smaller foam, so I glued those to the base as well.</li>
          <li>Once the glue was dried, I coated everything with some more glue and added some sand (you don't have to do this, but it gives the illusion of a sea floor) - this had some unintended consequences which will be mentioned farther down.</li>
          <li> Next was sectioning off the sides of the base and adding the epoxy resin. The epoxy resin was colour with green, blue and yellow dye. There are different techniques when adding resin i.e. enclosing the pouring space,
            however, before pouring make sure any gaps or edges are fully sealed. <b>*Note: when using Epoxy resin wear gloves and a suitable breathing mask (chemical mask). Epoxy is TOXIC. ALWAYS READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.</b></li>
        </ol>
        <h3> 4. Toppings </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Once the resin is cured, you can start adding some extras to the islands. I made some trees/ vines by twisting wire together and branching the wire off where I wanted. Afterwards I coated the wire in Mod Podge and painted it brown.
          The soft foam was added to the tops of the trees to simulate leaves.<img src="Floating islands large top.jpeg" alt="Top of floating island" class="left"></li>
          <li>I Stuck these vines into the islands and then proceeded to add bits of foam onto the island to simulate plant growths within the rock.</li>
          <li>I made a minature stonehenge using left over modelling foam to add some variety, I also had some leftover "fine flock" and grass to add as well.<img src="Floating island small top.jpeg" alt="Top of floating island" class="right"></li>
          <li>Finally, my favourite part, the water detail. To the base I added a reasonably thick layer of mod poge (yes on top of the resin).
          Then using a straw, I blew the mod podge around the base - once dry this will look like water ripples.</li>
          <li>Using the gel medium, I simulated larger waves around the waterfalls. I also added som gel medium to the waterfalls themselves to create an uneven slightly opaque surface(like running water)</li>
          <li>Once the gel and glue were dried, using a very minute amount of white paint, I dry brushed the surface of the water and the waterfalls - this enhances the water detail and
          makes it look like there is white water from waves.</li>
        </ol>
        </process>

       <h2>Disasters Section</h2>
       <p>There were only a coule of problem areas with this project thankfully, and they weren't really disasters.
       Part of the fun with model making is problem solving - if a mistake happens can we fix it? If we can't fix it, what would we do differently
     in the future?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The first mishap - the modelling foam that I was using did not glue firmly when using only Mod Podge, therefore I had to use gorilla glue.</li>
          <li>The second mishap - the sand trapped air, which tried to escape from the epoxy resin as it was drying, as a result - bubble formed. In the future instead
          of using a glue-sand mix, I will use and epoxy-sand mix.</li>
          </ol>
